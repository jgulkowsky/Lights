//todo: same ideas (almost) but more precise:
//todo: tapping on PLAY button switches mode to playing
//todo: tapping on PAUSE button switches mode to paused
//todo: when in paused mode the color is constant until user changes it manualy
//todo: when in plauing mode the color changes with transition
//todo: in playing mode user can change speed of changes with speedometer on the right hand side
//todo: normally ui is invisible to activate it user needs to tap (it doesn't change color in such situation)
//todo: in playing mode user will see PAUSE button to switch mode and speedometer
//todo: in paused mode user will see only PLAY button to switch mode
//todo: when ui is visible and user taps on screen the color is changed to some other random one (it's true for both modes)

//todo: maybe add chameleon mode -> so you can open invisible camera and telephone will change color to what's behind it?? (if possible to open camera in quiet mode)

//todo: maybe on every color there should be a lofi track to play
//todo: so when user taps on color change he also changes the music?? (it's far far in future but maybe...)
//todo: and also we could then combine it with pomodoro - so music plays during work and stops on brakes..
